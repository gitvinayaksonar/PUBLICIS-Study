Uses of nodemon:
    > no need of cutting server after changes since it watches.
    > Execute 2 scripts parallelly.


************** Package.json file, ***************
"webpack:server": "webpack --config webpack.server.js --watch" 
    > This script runs server.js, which in turn runs react-page/components (reactjsx, es6) and generates bundle.js in build folder.

Instead of cutting the server as soon as bundle.js is updated and restart, we use second script.

"webpack:start" : "nodemon --watch build --exec node build/bundle.js"
    > This script is equivalent to running build/bundle.js(===server.js) implies restart the server.
    > Script says watch entire build folder. If any changes, execute bundle.js
